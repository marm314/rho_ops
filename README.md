FCHK, WFN, and WFX files reading and computing properties.

In order to compile you need intel compiler icc and mkl/lapack installed. You have received a copy of Cuba.4.0 library in libcuba.a. 
In case it fails the precompiled version, follow the link: http://iqcc.udg.edu/~marm314/download/Cuba.tar.gz to get a copy of the sources files. 
The library is installed simple by doing:

tar -xvf *tar
cd Cuba-4.0
./configure
make lib

Then, copy the libcuba.a file to your current directory. The extender manual about all capabilities is given in pdf format.
